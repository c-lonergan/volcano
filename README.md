Microarray Data: Interactive Volcano Plot

Allows the user to explore and visualise the results of a differential expression analysis.

The data is read in using a reactive function.
The desired number of genes (specified by a numeric input field) is displayed in a table, sorted by significance.
Sliders allow the user to set thresholds for adjusted p-values and logFC values. 
A volcano plot showing the thresholds set and highlighting the differentially expressed genes at those thresholds is be displayed. 
The thresholds set and number of differentially expressed genes are shown in the plot title.
A summary table displayes useful statistics of highlighted genes.
